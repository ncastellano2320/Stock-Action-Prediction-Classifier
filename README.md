# Stock-Action-Prediction-Classifier 
## Extending Logistic Regression 

This project deploys a Logistic Regression model using a One-vs-All (OvA) approach to predict whether market participants should buy, sell, or hold based on daily financial trends (open, high, low, and close prices). By analyzing historical market data, the model provides probabilistic insights to support informed trading decisions.

Built for use by financial institutions and trading platforms, this machine learning solution aims to enhance data-driven investment strategies. The model’s customizable regularization ensures robust generalization to new market conditions. Future integration with UI/UX components will enable seamless end-user interaction and real-time predictions.

### Business Case: 

In the contemporary financial landscape, characterized by the emergence of algorithms in day-trading, our project aims to provide a refined machine learning solution tailored for the prediction of optimal investment actions. This comprehensive software package incorporates advanced techniques, notably logistic regression, to thoroughly analyze daily stock trends. The intended user base spans a diverse array of financial entities, encompassing investment banks, standard banks, hedge funds, and direct-to-consumer platforms like Robinhood. The package could be ready to push to customers following the completion of front-end and back-end UI/UX. In the end, the software package aspires to empower users with predictive probability insights, allowing them to navigate the complexities of financial markets with heightened confidence and strategic foresight.

### Prediction Task:

The prediction task is centered around deploying machine learning algorithms, specifically employing a logistic regression model in a one-versus-all (OvA) configuration. The primary goal is to predict whether market participants should buy, sell, or hold their positions based on daily trends observed in the data. These trends are derived from key financial indicators such as the opening price, high and low prices, and the closing price. By exploiting historical data patterns, the model aims to provide valuable insights into optimal investment actions, and such contributs to more informed decision-making in the dynamic and often unpredictable stock market environment.
