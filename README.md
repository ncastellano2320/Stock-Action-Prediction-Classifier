## Extending Logistic Regression 

This project deploys a Logistic Regression model using a One-vs-All (OvA) approach to predict whether market participants should buy, sell, or hold based on daily financial trends (open, high, low, and close prices). By analyzing historical market data, the model provides probabilistic insights to support informed trading decisions.

Built for use by financial institutions and trading platforms, this machine learning solution aims to enhance data-driven investment strategies. The model’s customizable regularization ensures robust generalization to new market conditions. Future integration with UI/UX components will enable seamless end-user interaction and real-time predictions.
